# files-> The data can be written, read and store
# There are 3 ways to access the data in a file
#1) Read mode (You can read the data )
#2) Write mode (You can write anything but it will erase if any data was present before )
#3) Append mode (You can update anythig without disturbing the previous data)

myfile=open("a.txt","w") # w is for write method

#Context manager-> it manages with the extra data like if some application is open it will close it for you
